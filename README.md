# Tower Defence Game Project

## About the game

This project is a recreation of a tower defense game, based on content from YouTube channel [Franks laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqc149iR-ALYkGM6TG-7vQ), putting together everything I learned after two weeks of full-time dedication to learn programming in Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp.

Basically, it's a blue squares fight against the bads red squeres!
