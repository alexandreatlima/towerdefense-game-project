# Tower Defence Game Project

## About the game

This project is a recreation of a defense game, based on the Franks laboratory tutorial, putting together everything I learned after two weeks of full-time dedication to learn programming in Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp.

Basically, it's a blue squares fight against the bads red squere!
